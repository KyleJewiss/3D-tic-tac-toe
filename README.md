# 3D-tic-tac-toe
#### **NOTE:** ðŸš§ This is a work in progress

This is a 2-player, 3 dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe terminal game. It is developed entirely in C++ and is simply a fun side project sharpen my C++ skils

The 3D Tic-Tac-Toe grid is customisable from a `2x2x2` grid to... well technically `256x256x256` because the input size is a uint8_t. But anything over a `30x30x30` won't render well in a terminal and to be honest anything over a `5x5x5` is totally impractical to play. To keep with tradition the default size is a `3x3x3` grid, but a `4x4x4` is fun too.
